## ✍️ Key Learnings & Notes

# AI  
What is AI?: AI is when machines are designed to do tasks that usually need human intelligence — like learning, recognizing patterns, solving problems, or making decisions.

Types of AI:

1. ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence): 
**What is ANI:** AI that can do one specific thing really well (one trick pony's).  
**Example:** A smart speaker that listens to voice commands, or a self-driving car that only drives  
**Analogy** A specialist—like a calculator that’s great at math, but can’t write an essay 

2. Generative AI (Generative Artificial Intelligence)
**What is GAI:** AI that can create things, like text, images, or music.  
**Example:** ChatGPT (writes answers), DALL·E (creates images), or music generators.
**Analogy:** A creative assistant—like a tool that helps you write, draw, or come up with ideas.

3. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
**What is AGI:** A future type of AI that would be as smart as a human at everything—or even smarter (AI smart enough to replace a human).     
**Example:** Does not exist yet. It's more science fiction for now.
**Analogy:** A robot brain that can think, learn, and reason like a human (or better)—but we’re not there yet.

AI Terminology:


What is data in AI: Data is the information you use to train an AI system. There are two types of data, unstructured which refers to images,photos and structured which refers to data in a spreadsheet(dataset).




# Machine Learning
What is Machine Learning: 
**Machine Learning (ML)** : is a tool used in AI that helps computers learn from data to make decisions or predictions.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning : is a type of machine learning where a computer learns from examples that already have the correct answers. The computer learns to map A to B using lots of examples.
**Example:** Think of it like teaching a student with flashcards. Each flashcard has a question (input) and a correct answer (output). Over time, the student learns to match the questions to the right answers.






Machine Learning Limitations:
