## ✍️ Key Learnings & Notes

# AI  
**What is AI?** : AI is when machines are designed to do tasks that usually need human intelligence — like learning, recognizing patterns, solving problems, or making decisions.

**Types of AI:**

1. ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence): 
**What is ANI:** AI that can do one specific thing really well (one trick pony's).  
**Example:** A smart speaker that listens to voice commands, or a self-driving car that only drives  
**Analogy** A specialist—like a calculator that’s great at math, but can’t write an essay 

2. Generative AI (Generative Artificial Intelligence)
**What is GAI:** AI that can create things, like text, images, or music.  
**Example:** ChatGPT (writes answers), DALL·E (creates images), or music generators.
**Analogy:** A creative assistant—like a tool that helps you write, draw, or come up with ideas.

3. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
**What is AGI:** A future type of AI that would be as smart as a human at everything—or even smarter (AI smart enough to replace a human).     
**Example:** Does not exist yet. It's more science fiction for now.
**Analogy:** A robot brain that can think, learn, and reason like a human (or better)—but we’re not there yet.

**How to Selection an AI Project**: Before commiting to  a AI project you need to conduct a due dilligence(analysing whether the project is worth the effort) on the project. You want to check if the project is feasible as well as valuable for the business. The two sets usually used are - What AI can do (Technical Dilligence Process) and Value it add to the business(Business Dilligence Process)

**Technical Dilligence** - Is when you analyse if the project is achievable. Finding out how much data is needed, how long it will take and how many people to build the system are important factors when analysing technical dilligence. 

**Business Dilligence** - Is when you analyse if the project is valuable to the business.
**Ethical Dilligence** - Does the AI project have a positive impact on society.

**Process Steps of Building AI Products** (Each step uses a different A to B mapping)

1. **Trigger Word Detection** – The system listens for a wake word like “Hey device” using machine learning.

2. **Speech Recognition** – After the wake word, it turns the spoken command into text.

3. **Intent Recognition** – It figures out what the user wants (e.g., play music, tell a joke).

4. **Command Execution** – The device carries out the action based on the user’s request.

**Roles of an AI Team**
 
**Software Engineers:** Build and maintain the software that runs AI systems, like smart devices or self-driving cars.

**Machine Learning Engineers:** Create and train AI models, making sure they work well with accurate results.

**Machine Learning Researchers:** Explore new AI techniques, often through deep research and experiments.

**Data Scientists:** Study data to find insights and help guide business decisions, sometimes doing tasks similar to ML engineers.

**Data Engineers:** Handle large amounts of data, making sure it’s stored properly and easy to use.

**AI Product Managers:** Decide which AI products to build and make sure they’re valuable and realistic to create.

 **AI Transformation Playbook**

**Step 1: Start/Execute with Pilot Projects** (Build momentum by building project that has the highest chance of success.)
- Begin with small, easy-to-win AI projects that can show results in 6–12 months. This helps build confidence and momentum.

**Step 2: Build an In-House AI Team**
- Set up a central AI team to support different departments and create shared tools and systems across the company.

**Step 3: Provide Company-Wide AI Training**
- Train everyone—not just engineers—on how AI affects their work. Executives need a few hours; engineers need deeper training to build real skills.

**Step 4: AI Strategy and Communication** (Leveraging AI to give an advantage)
AI Strategy Development
Once a company has real experience with AI projects, it's time to create a proper AI strategy. Strategies based only on theory often don’t work well — hands-on learning helps shape plans that actually fit the business.

Virtuous Cycle of AI**
The more data and users a company has, the better its AI can get. This makes the product stronger over time and harder for new competitors to catch up. For example, Blue River used AI in farming to keep improving their tools and stay ahead.

**Step 5: Internal and External Communications**
Clear communication is key. Companies need to explain AI changes to investors, regulators, and employees. Internally, sharing success stories helps reduce fear and attract talented people to work on AI.
 

**What is Data in AI**: Data is the information you use to train an AI system. There are two types of data, unstructured which refers to images,photos and structured which refers to data in a spreadsheet(dataset).

# Machine Learning
**Machine Learning (ML)**: is a way for computers to learn from examples, kind of like how people learn. Instead of being told exactly what to do step-by-step, the computer looks at a bunch of data and figures out how to make decisions on its own.

Types of Machine Learning:

**1. Supervised Learning**: is a type of machine learning where a computer learns from examples that already have the correct answers. The computer learns to map A(Input) to B(Output) using lots of examples.
**Example:** Think of it like teaching a student with flashcards. Each flashcard has a question (input) and a correct answer (output). Over time, the student learns to match the questions to the right answers.

**2. Deep Learning** : Deep learning is a type of machine learning that can understand really complex patterns in data — kind of like how our brains learn by seeing examples.

**Neural networks** are the main tool used in deep learning.
They’re computer models inspired by the human brain. Instead of actual brain cells, they use "nodes" or "neurons" that are connected in layers.

 How they work:
- You give it inputs (like a photo or numbers)
- It passes that info through layers of “neurons”
- It produces an output (like “this is a cat” or “the price will go up”)


**Workflow of Machine Learning Project:** Involves collecting, training and deploying data.
1. Collect Data
- Gather examples the AI can learn from.
  
Example (Self-Driving Car):
- Take pictures from a car and label where other cars are in those pictures.

2. Train the Model
- Use the collected data to teach the computer to recognize patterns.
- This is where the AI learns the A-to-B mapping (e.g., audio → word, image → car location).
- The model won’t be perfect at first — you have to test and improve it many times. This is called iteration.

3. Deploy the Model (Continuosly updating and improving the model with new data.)
- Put the trained AI model into the real world (e.g., in a smart speaker or self-driving car).
- After deployment, new data might show where the AI makes mistakes.
- **Example**, if it was trained on American voices, it might not understand British accents well.

# Data Science

**Data Science:** This is about using data to find useful information — like patterns, trends, or answers to questions — so that businesses can make smarter decisions.

**Workflow of Data Science Project**

**1. Collect Data:**
This is the first step, where you gather useful information — like:
- How many people visit a website
- Where they’re from
- What they click on

The goal is to understand how users behave so you can learn what’s working and what’s not.

**2. Analyze Data:**
Once you have the data, the next step is to study it carefully. You look for patterns, trends, or problems. For example:
- Are high shipping costs causing fewer sales?
- Do people shop more during holidays?
- This helps businesses figure out what’s helping or hurting their performance — and what they can improve.
