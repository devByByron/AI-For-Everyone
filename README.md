What is AI

Types of AI
1. ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence): 
**What it is:** AI that can do one specific thing really well (one trick pony's).  
**Example:** A smart speaker that listens to voice commands, or a self-driving car that only drives  
**Analogy** A specialist—like a calculator that’s great at math, but can’t write an essay 

2. Generative AI (Generative Artificial Intelligence)
**What it is:** AI that can create things, like text, images, or music.  
**Example:** ChatGPT (writes answers), DALL·E (creates images), or music generators.
**Analogy:** A creative assistant—like a tool that helps you write, draw, or come up with ideas.

3. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
**What it is:** A future type of AI that would be as smart as a human at everything—or even smarter (AI smart enough to replace a human).     
**Example:** Does not exist yet. It's more science fiction for now.
**Analogy:** A robot brain that can think, learn, and reason like a human (or better)—but we’re not there yet.

# Machine Learning?
**Machine Learning (ML)** : is a tool used in AI that helps computers learn from data to make decisions or predictions.

What is Supervised Learning - The most common type (Input to mapping A to B)

**Supervised learning** is a type of machine learning where a computer learns from examples that already have the correct answers.

**Example:** Think of it like teaching a student with flashcards. Each flashcard has a question (input) and a correct answer (output). Over time, the student learns to match the questions to the right answers.

- A = Input, B = Output
- The computer learns to map A to B using lots of examples.

Everyday Examples of Supervised Learning:
1. Speech Recognition
- **Input**: Audio
- **Output**: Text
  
2. Translation
- Input: English
- Output: Spanish or Chinese, etc.

Generative AI (like ChatGPT)
- Also uses supervised learning.
- The model learns to predict the next word in a sentence.
- Trained on billions of words from the internet.
- These models are called Large Language Models (LLMs).

Why Is Machine Learning So Powerful Now?
Because of 2 main things:
1. More Data
- We now store huge amounts of digital data (thanks to the internet and computers).
- More data = Better learning

2. Bigger Models (Neural Networks)
- New AI models (called neural networks or deep learning) get better and better as you give them more data.

- Large models + big data = Very powerful and accurate AI


What is data in AI
- Data is the information you use to train an AI system.
  
- Think of it like a giant spreadsheet (a dataset) where:
  - Input (A) is what you give the AI.
  - Output (B) is the correct answer you want the AI to learn.


































Building AI Projects 
What is Machine Learning
Machine learning is a way for computers to learn from data.
It helps turn input (A) into output (B) — like turning audio into text or images into labels.

Key Steps in a Machine Learning Project

1. Collect Data
- Gather examples the AI can learn from.
  
Example (Speech Recognition):
- Record people saying "Alexa" and other random words.

Example (Self-Driving Car):
- Take pictures from a car and label where other cars are in those pictures.

2. Train the Model
- Use the collected data to teach the computer to recognize patterns.
- This is where the AI learns the A-to-B mapping (e.g., audio → word, image → car location).
- The model won’t be perfect at first — you have to test and improve it many times. This is called iteration.

3. Deploy the Model
- Put the trained AI model into the real world (e.g., in a smart speaker or self-driving car).

- After deployment, new data might show where the AI makes mistakes.
  - **Example**, if it was trained on American voices, it might not understand British accents well.
    
- You can use this new data to update and improve the model over time.
