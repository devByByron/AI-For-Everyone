## ✍️ Key Learnings & Notes

# AI  
**What is AI?** : AI is when machines are designed to do tasks that usually need human intelligence — like learning, recognizing patterns, solving problems, or making decisions.

**Types of AI:**

1. ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence): 
**What is ANI:** AI that can do one specific thing really well (one trick pony's).  
**Example:** A smart speaker that listens to voice commands, or a self-driving car that only drives  
**Analogy** A specialist—like a calculator that’s great at math, but can’t write an essay 

2. Generative AI (Generative Artificial Intelligence)
**What is GAI:** AI that can create things, like text, images, or music.  
**Example:** ChatGPT (writes answers), DALL·E (creates images), or music generators.
**Analogy:** A creative assistant—like a tool that helps you write, draw, or come up with ideas.

3. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
**What is AGI:** A future type of AI that would be as smart as a human at everything—or even smarter (AI smart enough to replace a human).     
**Example:** Does not exist yet. It's more science fiction for now.
**Analogy:** A robot brain that can think, learn, and reason like a human (or better)—but we’re not there yet.


**What is data in AI**: Data is the information you use to train an AI system. There are two types of data, unstructured which refers to images,photos and structured which refers to data in a spreadsheet(dataset).

# Machine Learning
**Machine Learning (ML)**  Machine Learning is a way for computers to learn from examples, kind of like how people learn. Instead of being told exactly what to do step-by-step, the computer looks at a bunch of data and figures out how to make decisions on its own.

Types of Machine Learning:
**1. Supervised Learning** : is a type of machine learning where a computer learns from examples that already have the correct answers. The computer learns to map A(Input) to B(Output) using lots of examples.
**Example:** Think of it like teaching a student with flashcards. Each flashcard has a question (input) and a correct answer (output). Over time, the student learns to match the questions to the right answers.

**2. Deep Learning** : Deep learning is a type of machine learning that can understand really complex patterns in data — kind of like how our brains learn by seeing examples.

**Neural networks** are the main tool used in deep learning.
They’re computer models inspired by the human brain. Instead of actual brain cells, they use "nodes" or "neurons" that are connected in layers.

 How they work:
- You give it inputs (like a photo or numbers)
- It passes that info through layers of “neurons”
- It produces an output (like “this is a cat” or “the price will go up”)

Machine Learning Limitations:

**Workflow of Machine Learning Project:** Involves collecting, training and deploying data.
1. Collect Data
- Gather examples the AI can learn from.
  
Example (Self-Driving Car):
- Take pictures from a car and label where other cars are in those pictures.

2. Train the Model
- Use the collected data to teach the computer to recognize patterns.
- This is where the AI learns the A-to-B mapping (e.g., audio → word, image → car location).
- The model won’t be perfect at first — you have to test and improve it many times. This is called iteration.

3. Deploy the Model (Continuosly updating and improving the model with new data.)
- Put the trained AI model into the real world (e.g., in a smart speaker or self-driving car).
- After deployment, new data might show where the AI makes mistakes.
- **Example**, if it was trained on American voices, it might not understand British accents well.

# Data Science

**Data Science:** This is about using data to find useful information — like patterns, trends, or answers to questions — so that businesses can make smarter decisions.
