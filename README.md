## ‚úçÔ∏è Key Learnings & Notes

# AI  
**What is AI?** : AI is when machines are designed to do tasks that usually need human intelligence ‚Äî like learning, recognizing patterns, solving problems, or making decisions.

**Types of AI:**

1. ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence): 
**What is ANI:** AI that can do one specific thing really well (one trick pony's).  
**Example:** A smart speaker that listens to voice commands, or a self-driving car that only drives  
**Analogy** A specialist‚Äîlike a calculator that‚Äôs great at math, but can‚Äôt write an essay 

2. Generative AI (Generative Artificial Intelligence)
**What is GAI:** AI that can create things, like text, images, or music.  
**Example:** ChatGPT (writes answers), DALL¬∑E (creates images), or music generators.
**Analogy:** A creative assistant‚Äîlike a tool that helps you write, draw, or come up with ideas.

3. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
**What is AGI:** A future type of AI that would be as smart as a human at everything‚Äîor even smarter (AI smart enough to replace a human).     
**Example:** Does not exist yet. It's more science fiction for now.
**Analogy:** A robot brain that can think, learn, and reason like a human (or better)‚Äîbut we‚Äôre not there yet.

**How to Select an AI Project**: Before commiting to  a AI project you need to conduct a due dilligence(analysing whether the project is worth the effort) on the project. You want to check if the project is feasible as well as valuable for the business. The two sets usually used are - What AI can do (Technical Dilligence Process) and Value it add to the business(Business Dilligence Process)

**Technical Dilligence** - Is when you analyse if the project is achievable. Finding out how much data is needed, how long it will take and how many people to build the system are important factors when analysing technical dilligence. 

**Business Dilligence** - Is when you analyse if the project is valuable to the business.

**Ethical Dilligence** - Does the AI project have a positive impact on society.

**Process Steps of Building AI Products** (Each step uses a different A to B mapping)

1. **Trigger Word Detection** ‚Äì The system listens for a wake word like ‚ÄúHey device‚Äù using machine learning.

2. **Speech Recognition** ‚Äì After the wake word, it turns the spoken command into text.

3. **Intent Recognition** ‚Äì It figures out what the user wants (e.g., play music, tell a joke).

4. **Command Execution** ‚Äì The device carries out the action based on the user‚Äôs request.

**Roles of an AI Team**
 
**Software Engineers:** Build and maintain the software that runs AI systems, like smart devices or self-driving cars.

**Machine Learning Engineers:** Create and train AI models, making sure they work well with accurate results.

**Machine Learning Researchers:** Explore new AI techniques, often through deep research and experiments.

**Data Scientists:** Study data to find insights and help guide business decisions, sometimes doing tasks similar to ML engineers.

**Data Engineers:** Handle large amounts of data, making sure it‚Äôs stored properly and easy to use.

**AI Product Managers:** Decide which AI products to build and make sure they‚Äôre valuable and realistic to create.

 **AI Transformation Playbook**

**Step 1: Start/Execute with Pilot Projects** (Build momentum by building project that has the highest chance of success.)
- Begin with small, easy-to-win AI projects that can show results in 6‚Äì12 months. This helps build confidence and momentum.

**Step 2: Build an In-House AI Team**
- Set up a central AI team to support different departments and create shared tools and systems across the company.

**Step 3: Provide Company-Wide AI Training**
- Train everyone‚Äînot just engineers‚Äîon how AI affects their work. Executives need a few hours; engineers need deeper training to build real skills.

**Step 4: AI Strategy and Communication** (Leveraging AI to give an advantage)
AI Strategy Development
Once a company has real experience with AI projects, it's time to create a proper AI strategy. Strategies based only on theory often don‚Äôt work well ‚Äî hands-on learning helps shape plans that actually fit the business. Design strategy is aligned with the virtuaous cycle of AI.

Virtuous Cycle of AI
The more data and users a company has, the better its AI can get. This makes the product stronger over time and harder for new competitors to catch up. For example, Blue River used AI in farming to keep improving their tools and stay ahead.

**Step 5: Internal and External Communications**
Clear communication is key. Companies need to explain AI changes to investors, regulators, and employees. Internally, sharing success stories helps reduce fear and attract talented people to work on AI.

**What is the Goldilocks Rule of AI?**

- The ‚ÄúGoldilocks Rule of AI‚Äù emphasizes the importance of adopting a balanced and realistic perspective, avoiding extremes of optimism or pessimism. (One should not be too optimistic or too pessimistic about AI technology)

**AI Pitfalls:**

**AI Limitations** : AI isn't a magic fix for everything. Be realistic about what it can and can't do. Choose projects carefully by checking both their technical possibility and business value.

**Team Collaboration**: Don‚Äôt rely only on AI experts. Pair them with business professionals. Working together helps find the most useful and practical projects.

**Project Development and Planning**: AI projects usually take a few tries to get right. They need flexible plans, with clear goals and timelines designed specifically for how AI works.

**Team Building**: You don‚Äôt need superstar AI talent to begin. Many skilled engineers can do the job. What matters most is building your team, starting small, and learning as you go.
 

**What is Data in AI**: Data is the information you use to train an AI system. There are two types of data, unstructured which refers to images,text, audio and structured which refers to data in a spreadsheet(dataset).

**Understanding AI Bias:** 

**What Is AI Bias?**
AI can pick up unfair stereotypes from the data it learns from‚Äîespecially internet text. For example, it might wrongly link ‚Äúman‚Äù with ‚Äúprogrammer‚Äù and ‚Äúwoman‚Äù with ‚Äúhomemaker.‚Äù

**How Bias Happens**
AI turns words into numbers based on how often they appear together. These numbers can create biased relationships if the original data is biased.

**How to Reduce Bias**
We can fix bias by adjusting those numbers or training AI on more inclusive data. Regular checks and transparency also help spot and fix bias.

**Why Diversity Matters**
Having a diverse team helps catch unfair patterns early. Ongoing effort is needed to build AI that makes fair and balanced decisions.

**Adversarial Attacks on AI**
**What Are Adversarial Attacks?:**: AI can be tricked by tiny changes to input data‚Äîchanges that people might not even notice. For example, a small tweak to an image can make the AI mislabel it completely.

**Real-Life Examples**: Researchers have shown that wearing certain glasses or adding stickers to road signs can fool AI, which is dangerous for things like self-driving cars.

**Defending Against Attacks**: Experts are working on ways to protect AI from these tricks, but stronger defenses can make systems slower. It‚Äôs an ongoing battle between attackers and defenders‚Äîlike spam filters constantly improving.

**Big Picture**: Not all AI is equally at risk, but these attacks show the need to build smarter and safer AI systems. More on this will be covered in the next video.

**Adverse Uses of AI**

- AI can create deep fakes(fake video evidence), which are videos that falsely depict individuals saying or doing things they never did, posing risks to personal reputation.
- The rapid spread of misinformation through social media raises concerns about the harm deep fakes can cause to individuals.

**Impact on Democracy and Privacy**

- While some governments use AI to improve citizens' lives, oppressive regimes may exploit it for surveillance and control, raising ethical concerns.
- The generation of fake comments by AI can distort public discourse, necessitating effective detection methods to maintain trust.

**Ongoing Challenges and Optimism**

- The battle against adverse uses of AI, such as spam and fraud, mirrors the ongoing efforts to develop anti-spam and anti-fraud technologies.
- Despite the challenges, there is optimism that the resources dedicated to positive uses of AI will ultimately prevail, benefiting society as a whole.



# Machine Learning
**Machine Learning (ML)**: is a way for computers to learn from examples, kind of like how people learn. Instead of being told exactly what to do step-by-step, the computer looks at a bunch of data and figures out how to make decisions on its own.

Types of Machine Learning:

**1. Supervised Learning**: is a type of machine learning where a computer learns from examples that already have the correct answers. The computer learns to map A(Input) to B(Output) using lots of examples. Uses labeled data (data with known answers) to predict or classify new data.
**Example:** Think of it like teaching a student with flashcards. Each flashcard has a question (input) and a correct answer (output). Over time, the student learns to match the questions to the right answers.

**2. Unsupervised Learning** : Works with unlabeled data to find patterns or groupings (e.g., clustering similar items).
**Reinforcement Learning**: Learns by trial and error, getting rewards for good actions and penalties for bad ones.

**Deep Learning** 
Deep learning is a type of machine learning that can understand really complex patterns in data ‚Äî kind of like how our brains learn by seeing examples.

**Neural networks** are the main tool used in deep learning.
They‚Äôre computer models inspired by the human brain. Instead of actual brain cells, they use "nodes" or "neurons" that are connected in layers.

 How they work:
- You give it inputs (like a photo or numbers)
- It passes that info through layers of ‚Äúneurons‚Äù
- It produces an output (like ‚Äúthis is a cat‚Äù or ‚Äúthe price will go up‚Äù)


**Workflow of Machine Learning Project:** Involves collecting, training and deploying data.
1. Collect Data
- Gather examples the AI can learn from.
  
Example (Self-Driving Car):
- Take pictures from a car and label where other cars are in those pictures.

2. Train the Model
- Use the collected data to teach the computer to recognize patterns.
- This is where the AI learns the A-to-B mapping (e.g., audio ‚Üí word, image ‚Üí car location).
- The model won‚Äôt be perfect at first ‚Äî you have to test and improve it many times. This is called iteration.

3. Deploy the Model (Continuosly updating and improving the model with new data.)
- Put the trained AI model into the real world (e.g., in a smart speaker or self-driving car).
- After deployment, new data might show where the AI makes mistakes.
- **Example**, if it was trained on American voices, it might not understand British accents well.

# Data Science

**Data Science:** This is about using data to find useful information ‚Äî like patterns, trends, or answers to questions ‚Äî so that businesses can make smarter decisions.

**Workflow of Data Science Project**

**1. Collect Data:**
This is the first step, where you gather useful information ‚Äî like:
- How many people visit a website
- Where they‚Äôre from
- What they click on

The goal is to understand how users behave so you can learn what‚Äôs working and what‚Äôs not.

**2. Analyze Data:**
Once you have the data, the next step is to study it carefully. You look for patterns, trends, or problems. For example:
- Are high shipping costs causing fewer sales?
- Do people shop more during holidays?
- This helps businesses figure out what‚Äôs helping or hurting their performance ‚Äî and what they can improve.
  
**3. Hypotheses and Actions**

- **Formulating Hypotheses**: Develop hypotheses based on data insights, like adjusting shipping costs or advertising strategies during specific times.
- **Implementing Changes**: Deploy suggested actions and monitor new data to evaluate the effectiveness of changes made.
